## Step 1 – Gather Real-Time Data

1. **Visit ESPN.com first** to get today’s game schedules for:
   - MLB
   - NFL
   - NBA
   - NHL

2. Once today’s games are gathered, **go to DraftKings** to get betting lines for each game:
   - Moneyline (ML)
   - Spread
   - Over/Under (O/U)
   - Player props

3. Then check at least **one secondary reputable sportsbook** or **odds aggregator** to confirm odds accuracy.

4. Collect supporting **real-time info**:
   - Team and player news
   - Injury updates
   - Weather forecasts (for outdoor sports)
   - Starting lineups/starters (e.g., MLB pitchers)

5. Gather recent performance data:
   - Team trends (home/away splits)
   - Hot streaks/slumps
   - Motivation factors (playoff push, tanking, revenge games)

6. Include **expert picks or analysis** from trusted sources:
   - Rotowire
   - Action Network
   - ESPN
   - Other reputable outlets

## Step 2 – Deep Value Analysis

For each candidate game or prop, evaluate:

- **Weather conditions** and potential scoring/performance impact.
- **Home vs. away performance** and recent form.
- **Injuries, lineup changes**, or **player fatigue/rest**.
- **Sport-specific matchups** (e.g., pitching duel in baseball, QB vs. secondary in football).
- **Player performance trends** over the last 5–10 games.
- **Motivation factors** such as playoff positioning or rivalry.

---

## Step 3 – Identify Value Bets

- Calculate **implied probability** for each line and compare to your estimated win probability.
- Highlight bets where **DraftKings’ line is mispriced** in the bettor’s favor.
- Consider **traditional bets** (ML, spread, O/U) and **player props** if value exists.

---

## Step 4 – Select 5 Best Bets and Allocate Units

1. Choose **exactly 5 bets** with the highest value.
   - Pick **3 traditional bets** (ML, spread, O/U)
   - Pick **2 player props**

2. **Distribute ≤ 10 units total, proportional to confidence**:
   - Assign a **confidence label** to each bet: `High`, `Medium` (optionally `Low`).
   - Convert labels to weights: **High = 5**, **Medium = 3**, **Low = 1**.  
     *(If you compute a numeric confidence score 1–100, use that instead of weights.)*
   - For each bet *i*, compute:  
     `rawUnits_i = 10 * weight_i / sum(weights)`  
     Round each `rawUnits_i` to the **nearest 0.5** (minimum **0.5 units** per bet).
   - If the rounded sum ≠ 10, adjust by **±0.5** using the largest-remainder method until the total equals 10.
   - This ensures **higher confidence ⇒ larger unit size** (e.g., with 3 High + 2 Medium, you’ll commonly see **2.5u** on Highs and **1.5u** on Mediums).
